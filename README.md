# Project_Blog

This is a Blog Project where any user can post their blogs and can comment on other user's blogs. Once a user posts a blog, the blog will be saved in drafts and will not be published to all users. The blogs will be published to public only after the Admin user approves and publishes it.

In the same way, anyone can comment on any Blog and these comments will public only when Admin user approves it.

This help to avoid spam content on the website as the blogs and comments are first reviewed and then made public by Admin.
